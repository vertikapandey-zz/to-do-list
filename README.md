# ToDoList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

## Installing Dependencies

Run `npm install` for loading all the application dependencies

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## What could be improved given more time

1) ux could be improved 
2) test case could be written for a function which takes keyboard input
3) Could have written test cases for negative scenarios
4) Could have figured out a way for handling some lint error instead of disabling it
5) Could have created a class to create and object for task
6) Could have shown message on succesfully editing of task, also could have given a functionality to cancel a task opened for editing (Cancelling the edit)
